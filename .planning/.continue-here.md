<current_state>
Phase 7 (Subtask Generation) complete. All planned work for milestone finished except Phase 5 (Integration Verification) which was skipped to implement features first.

The subtask generation feature is now fully integrated:
- Schema, server actions, executor, AI prompts (07-01, 07-02)
- UI components (07-04)
- Epic page integration (07-05)
</current_state>

<completed_work>
**This session (07-05):**
- Created SubtaskGenerationSection wrapper component
- Integrated subtask generation UI into epic detail page
- Added subtask counts to story selection dialog
- Auto-detect active runs on page load

**Phase 7 overall:**
- 07-01: Subtask model + RunStory junction
- 07-02: Server actions + executor + AI prompts
- 07-03: Progress API endpoint
- 07-04: SubtaskConfigDialog + SubtaskRunProgress components
- 07-05: Epic page integration
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
**Phase 5: Integration Verification** (skipped, still pending)
- End-to-end testing of all three generative flows
- Card analysis, epic generation, story generation verification

**Future enhancements:**
- Subtask display in story detail/expansion (marked as future in ROADMAP.md)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Wrapper component pattern for client/server boundary (SubtaskGenerationSection)
- Auto-detect existing active runs via useActiveSubtaskRun hook
- Subtask generation shows below stories table (follows story generation UI pattern)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None - phase complete.
</blockers>

<context>
The milestone is effectively complete. Phase 5 (Integration Verification) was skipped because the user preferred to implement features first. All generative flows now have:
- Progress indicators
- Real-time polling
- Proper error handling

Subtask generation follows the same Run + Junction + Executor + Polling pattern established for epics and stories.

Choose one:
1. `/gsd:plan-phase 5` - Create integration verification plan
2. `/gsd:complete-milestone` - Archive milestone and prepare for next
3. Test subtask generation manually on Vercel production
