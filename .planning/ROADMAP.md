# Roadmap: Requirements Foundry - Generative Pipeline Fix

## Milestones

- ✅ [v1.0 Generative Pipeline Fix](milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md) (Phases 1-9) — SHIPPED 2026-01-15
- ✅ [v1.1 UX Polish](milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md) (Phases 10-12) — SHIPPED 2026-01-20
- ✅ [v1.2 MSS Integration](milestones/v1.2-ROADMAP.md) (Phases 13-17) — SHIPPED 2026-01-27
- 🚧 **v1.3 Contextual Upload** - Phases 18-20 (in progress)

## Overview

This roadmap addressed three regressed generative flows: card analysis (frozen progress), epic generation (no progress indicator), and story generation (silent timeout failures). All flows now work with real-time progress feedback, plus subtask generation and performance optimizations.

### 🚧 v1.3 Contextual Upload (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Enhance document analysis with user-provided project context and AI-driven clarifying questions

#### Phase 18: Context Schema & Upload Form ✓

**Goal**: Add structured context fields during document upload including project basics, document classification, and notes
**Depends on**: Phase 17 (v1.2 complete)
**Research**: Unlikely (internal patterns, existing form components)
**Plans**: 1/1 complete

Plans:
- [x] 18-01: Context Schema & Upload Form Integration — completed 2026-01-27

#### Phase 19: AI Question Generation

**Goal**: After upload and initial context, AI reviews documents and generates one-shot clarifying questions for user to answer
**Depends on**: Phase 18
**Research**: Unlikely (existing Claude/LLM integration patterns)
**Plans**: 2 planned

Plans:
- [x] 19-01: Data Model & AI Service — UploadContext extension, question generator, server actions — completed 2026-01-27
- [ ] 19-02: UI Components & Flow Integration — Question display component, upload/analysis flow changes

#### Phase 20: Context Integration

**Goal**: Card analysis receives full context (user-provided + AI Q&A answers) to produce better-informed requirements
**Depends on**: Phase 19
**Research**: Unlikely (extending existing card analysis flow)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 20-01: TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 20 to break down)
