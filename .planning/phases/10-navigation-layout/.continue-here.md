<current_state>
Plan 10-03 (Mobile Nav & Layout Polish) is COMPLETE. All tasks executed, tested, and committed.
Also fixed a bonus bug: subtask generation error handling (3 commits).
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- Task 1: Add project sections to mobile navigation - Done (c784b9c)
- Task 2: Polish page layout spacing - Done (73f8a03)
- Task 3: Checkpoint verification - Done (build verified)

Bonus bug fixes (user reported subtask generation showing "Unknown error"):
- 5ba0c92: Save error message before finalizing subtask run
- b69e441: Safe JSON parse for story acceptanceCriteria
- 1b2cc00: Preserve errorMsg in finalizeSubtaskRun
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
- Write 10-03-SUMMARY.md (optional, plan complete)
- Update STATE.md to reflect Phase 10 completion
- Update ROADMAP.md to mark Phase 10 complete
- Begin Phase 11 (Data Display & Hierarchy)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Mobile nav mirrors desktop sidebar pattern exactly (projectSections array, PROJECT_PATH_REGEX)
- Uses getProjectName server action for project name in mobile nav header
- Runs page layout fixed by adding max-w-7xl mx-auto wrapper for consistency
- Error handling: safe JSON.parse with fallback to single-item array instead of crashing
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None. User confirmed subtask generation working after adding Anthropic credits.
</blockers>

<context>
Phase 10 is functionally complete. Three plans executed:
- 10-01: Enhanced sidebar with project context sections
- 10-02: Breadcrumb navigation in page headers
- 10-03: Mobile nav parity and layout polish

The bug fix work (error handling) was reactive to user report, not in original plan.
Next phase (11) is "Data Display & Hierarchy" - visualizing card/epic/story/subtask relationships.
</context>

<next_action>
Start with: Create 10-03-SUMMARY.md, update STATE.md and ROADMAP.md to mark Phase 10 complete, then run /gsd:plan-phase 11 to break down Phase 11.
