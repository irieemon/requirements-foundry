<objective>
Verify card analysis and epic generation flows work end-to-end with proper progress feedback on production.

Purpose: Confirm Phase 1-3 fixes work correctly in the deployed Vercel environment.
Output: Verified flows with documented behavior, updated roadmap checklist.

# Key constraint from STATE.md:
**Remote testing only**: User can only test on Vercel production, not locally.

# What was fixed:
- 01-02: Cache headers added to batch-story endpoint, RunLogger instrumentation added
- 02-01: Card analysis progress panel with elapsed time, "(X analyzing)" indicator, animated progress bar
- 03-01: Epic generation button with elapsed time counter and animated icon

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Verify deployment is accessible and build passes</name>
  <files>N/A - verification only</files>
  <action>
Run TypeScript type check and build to ensure no regressions. Then verify the production URL is accessible.

```bash
npm run build
```

Capture any errors. If build fails, this plan cannot proceed - document failure and stop.

Then ask user for the production URL if not already known.
  </action>
  <verify>Build exits with code 0, no TypeScript errors</verify>
  <done>Build successful, production URL confirmed</done>

  <what-built>Card analysis flow with real-time progress (Phase 2 fix)</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Test: Upload a document and observe card analysis progress**

1. Navigate to your production URL
2. Create a new project or use existing one
3. Upload a requirements document (PDF or text)
4. **Observe the progress panel during analysis:**
   - Does "Currently Processing" banner appear with document name?
   - Does elapsed time counter update every second?
   - Does progress text show "(X analyzing)" during processing?
   - Does progress bar show animated striped section for in-progress items?
5. Wait for completion
6. Confirm cards are created and displayed

**Expected behavior:**
- Progress panel updates in real-time (not frozen)
- Elapsed time counts up visibly
- Clear indication of which document is being processed
- Smooth transition to completion state
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "pass" if working correctly, or describe specific issues observed</resume-signal>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Epic generation flow with elapsed time indicator (Phase 3 fix)</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Test: Generate epics from analyzed cards and observe progress**

1. Navigate to project with analyzed cards
2. Click "Generate Epics" button (or equivalent)
3. **Observe the button state during generation:**
   - Does button show loading state with animated icon?
   - Does elapsed time counter appear and update?
   - Is there visual feedback that AI is processing?
4. Wait for completion
5. Confirm epics are created and displayed

**Expected behavior:**
- Button shows animated Sparkles icon (pulsing)
- Elapsed time displays and increments (e.g., "5s", "10s", "15s")
- Clear completion state when done
- Epics appear in the UI

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] Build passes without errors
- [ ] Card analysis shows real-time progress updates
- [ ] Epic generation shows elapsed time during processing
- [ ] Both flows complete successfully with expected output
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- Build verification passes
- Card analysis progress panel works as designed (elapsed time, currently processing, animated bar)
- Epic generation button shows loading state with elapsed time
- User confirms both flows work correctly on production
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-integration-verification/05-01-SUMMARY.md`:

# Phase 5 Plan 1: Foundational Flow Verification Summary

**[Result summary: pass/fail for each flow]**

## Verification Results

| Flow | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Card Analysis Progress | [pass/fail] | [observations] |
| Epic Generation Progress | [pass/fail] | [observations] |

## Issues Found

[Any issues discovered, or "None"]

## Next Step

Ready for 05-02-PLAN.md (Story generation + Stories page + Subtask generation verification)
