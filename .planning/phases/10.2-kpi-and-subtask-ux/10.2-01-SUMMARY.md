# Phase 10.2 Plan 01: KPI & Subtask UX Summary

**KPI cards now fit in single row on desktop; subtask generation accessible from main Subtasks section.**

## Accomplishments

- Fixed KPI strip to display 6 cards in one row on desktop (≥1280px)
- Added responsive grid breakpoints: 2 cols (sm), 3 cols (md), 6 cols (xl)
- Added "Generate Subtasks" button to SubtasksSection header
- Created project-wide subtask generation dialog (all stories across all epics)
- Empty state now shows clear CTA button instead of just text

## Files Created/Modified

- `components/ui/kpi-card.tsx` - Updated grid classes for 6-column layout on xl screens
- `components/subtasks/subtasks-section.tsx` - Added projectId prop, generation button, improved empty state
- `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx` - Pass projectId to SubtasksSection

## Decisions Made

- Used `xl:grid-cols-6` breakpoint (1280px+) for all 6 KPIs in one row
- Project-wide subtask generation shows all stories from all epics in single dialog
- Kept existing per-epic generation in epic detail page as alternative path

## Issues Encountered

None.

## Next Step

Phase 10.2 complete. Update roadmap and proceed to Phase 11 (Data Display & Hierarchy).
