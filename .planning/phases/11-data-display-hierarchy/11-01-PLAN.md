<objective>
Redesign Epic Grid with modern card aesthetics and better visual hierarchy.

Purpose: Epic cards are the entry point to the data hierarchy. A visual refresh here sets the foundation for the rest of Phase 11.
Output: Modern epic cards with improved visual density, clearer information hierarchy, and subtle depth cues.

**Current state:**
- Epic cards use basic Card with code badge, title, description, impact/effort badges
- Cards are functional but visually flat
- No clear visual weight differentiation between primary content (title) and metadata

**Design direction:**
- Clean, minimal aesthetic (Notion/Linear style per v1.1 goals)
- Use spacing and typography to create hierarchy instead of borders/shadows
- Subtle color coding for epic metadata (impact, effort)
- Show story count more prominently as primary metric

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create EpicCard component with modern styling</name>
  <files>components/epics/epic-card.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create a new EpicCard component with improved visual design:

1. Structure:
   - Header: Code badge (left) + story count badge (right)
   - Title: Prominent, max 2 lines with line-clamp
   - Theme: Subtle text below title (if exists)
   - Description: Muted, max 2 lines
   - Footer: Impact/effort badges in a row

2. Styling guidelines:
   - Use `border-border/40` for subtler borders
   - Hover: `hover:border-border hover:shadow-sm` (subtle lift)
   - Padding: `p-4` for tighter feel
   - Use `text-sm` for description, `text-xs` for badges
   - Story count badge: use primary variant to draw attention

3. Impact color coding:
   - High: `text-emerald-600 bg-emerald-50`
   - Medium: `text-amber-600 bg-amber-50`
   - Low: `text-slate-600 bg-slate-100`

4. Effort sizing:
   - S/M/L displayed as "Small", "Medium", "Large" in secondary badge

Props: Same as current (epic object with id, code, title, theme, description, effort, impact, priority, _count.stories)
  </action>
  <verify>Component renders without TypeScript errors: `npx tsc --noEmit`</verify>
  <done>EpicCard component exists with modern card styling and clear visual hierarchy</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update EpicGrid to use new EpicCard</name>
  <files>components/epics/epic-grid.tsx</files>
  <action>
1. Import the new EpicCard component
2. Replace inline card JSX with EpicCard component
3. Remove the inline helper functions (getImpactColor, getEffortLabel) - move to EpicCard
4. Keep the grid layout: `grid gap-4 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`
5. EpicGrid becomes a thin wrapper that maps epics to EpicCards

The Link wrapper stays in EpicGrid (not in EpicCard) to keep the card component presentation-only.
  </action>
  <verify>`npm run build` succeeds</verify>
  <done>EpicGrid uses EpicCard component, maintains same layout behavior</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Redesigned epic cards with modern visual styling</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run: npm run dev
    2. Navigate to a project with epics
    3. Click "Epics" in KPI strip
    4. Verify:
       - Cards have subtle borders and gentle hover effect
       - Story count badge is visually prominent
       - Impact badge uses color coding (green/amber/gray)
       - Title is clearly the primary element
       - Description is de-emphasized
    5. Click an epic card - verify navigation still works

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds
- [ ] Epic cards render with new styling
- [ ] Click navigation works
- [ ] No console errors
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- Epic cards have modern, clean visual design
- Visual hierarchy is clear (title > description > metadata)
- Story count is prominent
- Impact badges are color-coded
- Hover states are subtle but noticeable
</success_criteria>
